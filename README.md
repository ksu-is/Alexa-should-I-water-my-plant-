# Alexa, should I water my plant?
There would be a humidity sensor that you put into the plant soil that is connected to a raspberry pi that sends information to Alexa. Alexa would have a skill that allows you to ask her if you should water your plants and she would give back a yes or no response. The raspberry pi would have a program that takes the information from the moisture meter and processes to give a yes or no answer. When you ask Alexa if you should water the plant, she would search for information from the raspberry pi. 
This is suposed to help people that are new to plant care, peole that love to have plants but they do not have the time to take proper care of them, and people that just love technology and plants. This would also be helpful if someone was out of town and they wanted to check on their plants because you can control Alexa remotely through an app on any smartphone.
