# Alexa, should I water my plant?
There could be a humidity sensor that you put into the plant soil that is connected to a raspberry pi that sends information to Alexa. Alexa would have a skill that allows you to ask her if you should water your plants and she would give back a yes or no response. The raspberry pi would have a program that takes the information from the moisture meter and processes to give a yes or no answer. When you ask Alexa if you should water the plant, she would search for information from the raspberry pi.
